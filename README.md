# Computer Vision - object detection
A basic Object detection on images using TFOD2 and OPENCV.

# Step 1: Annotate the dataset
  
  Look for images (data) to train & test your model. For training, we need labeled images, i.e., labeled dataset. To create this, we will use labelImg, a python liberary created specifically for this purpose. Use the following command to download the liberary:
  
    pip install labelImg

  Through this, we need to upload the images, select the object and give a label. It looks something like this:
  

# Step 2: Training model.
Follow the code files to understand more.
The model detects the presence on cars on an image using a custome trained model. For the pre trained model, only a single item is classified for training.
The final output is as follows:
